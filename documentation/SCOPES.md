# SCOPES

Different types of symbols and operators have their own "scope", which can be edited to use a different color or font style. A couple of lists can be found [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html#keyword) and [here](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars), though keep in mind these aren't necessarily exhaustive - there are certain properties that you won't find on either of these lists.
