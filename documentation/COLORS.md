# COLORS

Native macOS uses a color pallette modelled after Xcode's where possible. Where there are differences in features between Visual Studio Code and Xcode, either the nearest color available in Xcode is used, one of [Apple's official colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/color/) is used, or a color is created based on the existing pallette.

All colors use the standard RRGGBBAA format, with lowercase letters for better at-a-glance readability.
